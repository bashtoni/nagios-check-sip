Pre-Requisites
--------------

- Working Nagios install
- Perl 5 (tested with Perl 5.6.1 and 5.8)

Installation
------------

- Copy to your nagios plugins directory (possibly /usr/lib/nagios/plugins)
- Add check_sip to your nagios config.  This may be in the file 
  'checkcommands.cfg', or under /etc/nagios-plugins/config (under Debian) 
  An example:

/etc/nagios-plugins/config/sip.cfg
define command{
        command_name    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_sip
	command_line    $USER1$/check_sip -u $ARG1$ -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -w 5
}

- Alter your services.cfg to include a check against the check_sip command, 
e.g.:

define service{
        use                             generic-service
        host_name                       bubblegum
        service_description             SIP test
        check_command                   check_sip!sip:sip@voip.bashton.com
        contact_groups                  voip-admins
        max_check_attempts              4
        normal_check_interval           5
        retry_check_interval            1
        notification_interval           240
        check_period                    24x7
        notification_period             24x7
        notification_options            c,r
}

Variables
---------

check_sip requires the following variable:

  -u  Full SIP uri, eg sip:uri@example.com

The following optional variables are also available:

  -f From SIP uri
  -H Host to connect to
  -p Port to connect to
  -w Seconds after which to respond with a warning
  -s Switch off standard behavior: after this, all SIP-responses are counted 
      as success

Known bugs/issues
-----------------

check_sip does not presently support SRV records.  You can use the -H and -p
options to query the correct host.
